### constructible - Python library for exact representation of constructible numbers
Constructible numbers are the lengths you can construct by ruler and compass. Its all the numbers which can be obtained from natural numbers by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers and by taking square roots. The exact representation avoids rounding issues that araise when using floating point numbers. 

This library is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/constructible/) and uses TravisCI for integration testing.
