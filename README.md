I like to create a github repository even for just trying out something programming related, without it being a serious project. So some of my repos are 
in no useable state. Heres a quick overview of what might interest you

### [constructible](https://github.com/leovt/constructible) - Python library for exact representation of constructible numbers
Constructible numbers are the lengths you can construct by ruler and compass. Its all the numbers which can be obtained from natural numbers by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers and by taking square roots. The exact representation avoids rounding issues that araise when using floating point numbers. 

This library is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/constructible/) and uses TravisCI for integration testing.

### [sicp](https://github.com/leovt/sicp) - Creating an Ebook in epub format
A HTML version of the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" is available for free under a CC license. In order to read it on my ebook 
reading device I transformed the HTML version into the epub format using Python.
